# meis-bakery

### FRONTEND SETUP

1. Clone https://github.com/Roge-L/meis-bakery

2. Make sure you have the latest version of Node.js installed and set as default

3. Run the following:
```
cd meisbakery/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
4. Refer to the wireframe and build the app.  We are using Next.js for server-side rendering, TypeScript to streamline future maintenance, and Tailwind CSS to style everything in the easiest possible way.

### BACKEND SETUP

Wait for Roger to host his MySQL database somewhere so everyone can use our backend (Strapi)
