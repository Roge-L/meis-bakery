### FRONTEND SETUP

1. Clone https://github.com/Roge-L/meis-bakery

2. Make sure you have the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed and set as default

3. Run the following:
```
cd meisbakery/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
4. Refer to the [wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/BYgFvpG63wI3a3CmLXfeW4/Mei's-Bakery-Mobile-Wireframe?node-id=0%3A1) and build the app.  We are using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for server-side rendering, [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to streamline future maintenance, and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style everything in the easiest possible way.

### BACKEND SETUP

Wait for Roger to host his MySQL database somewhere so everyone can use our backend ([Strapi](https://strapi.io/))
